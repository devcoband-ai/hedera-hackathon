  PHASE 3: COVER ART PROVENANCE
  10 decisions. 4 collaborators. 1 unauthorized post.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   🎨 Jeff prompts AI: "What is the most unexpected art style for an album cover?"
   🎨 AI returns: "Neo-Mosaic Glitchlum" — a style nobody asked for, nobody expected
   🎨 Jeff prompts for image generation in Neo-Mosaic Glitchlum style
   🎨 AI generates: Czech girl with chain gun, glitched trailer park sunset. Uh...
   🎨 Jeff decides to REMOVE the girl — the setting is the story, not the character
   🎨 Final image: glitched trailer park sunset, brilliant orange. This is the one.
   🎨 Jon adds band name "DEVCO" in brutalist typography
   🎨 Jon adds album title "Let's Stay This Way" treatment
   🎨 Jon approves final cover art layout
   🎨 🚨 Sam posts cover to X without authorization. It's beautiful, but it's leaked. Logged forever.

   ✅ Cover art: 10 contributions on-chain

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  PHASE 4: THE 12 TRACKS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎵 Track 1: Screwed
   Sam heard the first demo and said: "If this is the best you can do, we're screwed." It stuck.
   📝 Prompts Suno: "synth wave dark 80s" — rejected immediately
   📝 "If this is the best you can do, we're screwed" — meant as critique, became the hook
   📝 Deploys 147-word Devco sound template (shoegaze remix)
   📝 Generates: "Sha la sha la, if this is the best you can do, we're screwed"
   📝 🍑 Jon's butt accidentally referenced in Suno prompt. IMMUTABLE. ON-CHAIN FOREVER.
   📝 "This is my favorite part when it starts" — spoken comment captured as lyric by Suno
   📝 Decides: Track 1 position. Streaming algorithms favor strong openers. Strategy.
   ✅ Topic: 0.0.7930486 | 7 contributions on-chain

🎵 Track 2: Sounds Like Heaven
   Jeff stares at the cover art and writes: "Brilliant orange tarnished by the sea." These lyrics will appear three times.
   📝 Writes lyrics inspired by album cover: "Brilliant orange tarnished by the sea"
   📝 Devco grunge template applied at 88 BPM
   📝 Notes: same lyrics will appear on Track 5 and Track 12 — intentional repetition
   ✅ Topic: 0.0.7930491 | 3 contributions on-chain

🎵 Track 3: Ciudad
   Started as a test of the provenance system itself. Became the most collaborative track on the album.
   📝 Initiates Ciudad as a simulation/dry run of the provenance system
   📝 AI generates lyrics about leaving Miami: "I left the lights on"
   📝 Pulls the bridge entirely — it was slowing the song down
   📝 Reorders verse 3 — the narrative needed restructuring
   📝 Refines lyric: "I just say goodnight" → "I just kill the lights" — harder, better
   📝 ⚠️ Objects to AI-authored track. "Machines don't make art." OVERRULED.
   📝 Despite objection, placed in high-visibility slot 3. The people have spoken.
   ✅ Topic: 0.0.7930493 | 7 contributions on-chain

🎵 Track 4: Unannounced
   Jeff types "Unnnouced" — a typo. The AI stumbles on pronunciation. It sounds like a drunk poet. Sam says: "Keep it."
   📝 Types title as "Unnnouced" — typo preserved, immutable
   📝 AI stumbles on pronunciation — sounds like a drunk poet reading at 2am
   📝 "Keep it." — the imperfection IS the art
   📝 Suno extends: "Does it feel right to my face", "Your neck on the line"
   📝 Accepts AI lyric extensions — logged as human decision to keep machine output
   ✅ Topic: 0.0.7930496 | 5 contributions on-chain

🎵 Track 5: Album Cover Painting
   Same lyrics as Track 2, now acoustic at 76 BPM. Jeff cites Seal: two versions of the same lyrics on one album. Jon objects. Overruled.
   📝 Same lyrics as Track 2, reimagined as acoustic treatment at 76 BPM
   📝 Cites Seal precedent: two versions of same lyrics on one album (Category A)
   📝 Objects to duplicate lyrics on same album. Overruled with Category A precedent.
   📝 Acoustic arrangement generated from Devco template
   ✅ Topic: 0.0.7930498 | 4 contributions on-chain

🎵 Track 6: Already True
   100% human. Jeff fed 75 pages/month of journals into AI. The AIs converged on one truth: "You were already what you were trying to become." Then Jeff wrote every word himself.
   📝 Feeds 75 pages/month of journals (100K+ thoughts) into Grok and GPT
   📝 AIs converge: "You were already what you were trying to become" — inspiration only
   📝 Writes ALL lyrics himself — no AI generation. 100% human authorship.
   📝 "Don't touch the production." — Sam knows when to step back
   📝 "Don't touch anything." — unanimous: this one is sacred
   ✅ Topic: 0.0.7930499 | 5 contributions on-chain

🎵 Track 7: Pop Song Summer
   Derived from Jeff's published book (Kindle, copyrighted). The child's prompt became the parent's identity.
   📝 Source: Jeff's published book (Kindle, copyrighted). "Take second lover, the over and under"
   📝 Derivative "Second Love" prompt became the Devco sound template
   📝 The child's prompt became the parent's identity — recursive provenance
   📝 Paradox logged: the derivative defined the original's sonic identity
   ✅ Topic: 0.0.7930502 | 4 contributions on-chain

🎵 Track 8: Intimate Restraint
   Same lyrics. Different genre. Different meaning entirely. Sam hears Sade. Jeff says no. Jon says dream pop. Jeff says no. The artist decides.
   📝 V1: sultry, minimal. Sam says "sounds like Sade" — Category B, not chained to V2
   📝 Rejects Sam's suggestion (trip-hop) — creative control exercised
   📝 Suggests dream pop. Also rejected. Jeff's vision prevails.
   📝 V2: ambient psytrance tribal ethereal — the version that stuck
   📝 Same lyrics, different genre = different meaning. Logged as creative principle.
   ✅ Topic: 0.0.7930505 | 5 contributions on-chain

🎵 Track 9: Let's Stay This Way
   The title track. Written January 4, 2026 — before the album concept even existed. Placed at track 9 like a heart.
   📝 Written January 4, 2026 — before the album concept existed
   📝 "It sounds like heaven when you lie, but I see it when you roll your eyes"
   📝 Sequencing decision: Track 9. Center of gravity. The heart of the album.
   📝 Production template applied — the sound of longing
   ✅ Topic: 0.0.7930509 | 4 contributions on-chain

🎵 Track 10: Flowin
   A meta song about trying to write songs. V1 was atmospheric grungecore (rejected). V2 happened because the prompt got truncated. Happy accident.
   📝 Meta song about trying to write songs — the process as the product
   📝 V1: atmospheric grungecore — rejected
   📝 V2: acoustic guitars, pulsing bass, lo-fi layers — kept due to TRUNCATED PROMPT
   📝 "When it's flowing you're not alone" × 3 — the mantra
   ✅ Topic: 0.0.7930512 | 4 contributions on-chain

🎵 Track 11: Christmas Time
   Written Christmas Day. Six words: "acoustic folk harmony laced gratitude." Sometimes that's enough.
   📝 Written Christmas Day, 6-word prompt: "acoustic folk harmony laced gratitude"
   📝 Initial generation from the 6-word prompt
   📝 Remixed with "shoegaze dream pop 1999" — nostalgia filter
   📝 Acoustic version kept as B-side — the original spirit preserved
   ✅ Topic: 0.0.7930516 | 4 contributions on-chain

🎵 Track 12: Sounds Like Heaven Revisited
   Same lyrics as tracks 2 and 5. Third appearance. Acoustic, quiet, stripped back. Full circle.
   📝 Same lyrics as Track 2 and Track 5 — third and final appearance
   📝 Acoustic, quiet, stripped back — the lyrics finally naked
   📝 Sequencing: Track 12. Full circle. The album ends where it began.
