# Hedera Hackathon — Provenance as a Service

**AI made the music. The blockchain proves I'm the artist.**

## Concept

A music provenance platform that uses Hedera Consensus Service to create immutable proof of human creative involvement in AI-assisted music production.

Every creative decision — the prompt, the lyric edit, the rejection, the final pick — is a timestamped message on a Hedera topic. The result: a provenance record that proves human artistry, solving the distribution gatekeeping problem for AI-assisted music.

## Stack

- **Suno** — AI music generation
- **Claude (DevCo)** — Platform intelligence, creative workflow
- **Grok** — Promotion / marketing layer (TBD)
- **Hedera Consensus Service** — Immutable provenance chain
- **DevCo Platform** — Rails-based creative workflow engine

## How It Works

1. Create a Hedera topic for each song
2. Log every creative iteration as a consensus message (prompts, edits, rejections, selections)
3. Build a provenance DAG from the message history
4. Export a provenance record for distribution submission
5. Prove human involvement through the iteration trail — "the iteration IS the human contribution"
